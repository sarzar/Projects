          <p>This website was created by two legends; Sarim Zia & Bilal Choudhary. What's amazing is that we finally beat
            css! It only took a few days, give or take 3 months... The question that lies is whether the Jets win a stanley
            cup first or will we finish the website first. But what's important is that we beat it. Now it's time to do this 
            10-15 more times, and then probably lose to javascript... But in the mean time, get your chai ready with your tuc 
            biscuit because  "picture toh abhi baki hai mairai dost."
